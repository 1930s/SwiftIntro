# SwiftIntro
A memory game implementation fetching images from Instagram. This project aims to introduce you to Swift whatever experience level you are currently at!

## Tasks

### This looks interesting
1. Change the color of the START GAME button
2. Change this distance between view X and Y

### I think I got a good grip of it
1. Change the duration of the flip card animation
2. Make it possible to add a custom size of the memory game board

### Bring it on
You will be checking out the git branch called "challenging", and you will have to implement some game logic yourself
1. Implement the logic for matching cards
2. Make it possible to X, Y, Z
