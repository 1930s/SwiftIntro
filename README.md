# SwiftIntro
A memory game implementation fetching images from Instagram. This project aims to introduce you to Swift whatever experience level you are currently at!

## Tasks

### This looks interesting 
#### Design and Storyboard 
1. Change the color of the PLAY button
2. Change the the backgroundcolor of the cards
3. Change the distance between view X and Y
#### Code 
3. Change the duration of the flip card animation

### I think I've got a good grip of it

### Bring it on
You will be checking out the git branch called "challenging", and you will have to implement some game logic yourself.

1. Implement the logic for when you found a pair (when two card matches)
2. Change the feedback message from "Good job" to a dynamic title that changes according to how well it went.
For example "Well done!", "Not sooo bad", "That was Horrible" etc  (should work for all Lelvels)


Make it possible to add a custom size of the memory game board
Implement white space handling for the username textfield.
Add some Error Handeling, (message if username dosn't exist, or if no images could be loaded)
Change the quit button label to insetead use a quit icon. From example: 
change the username placeholder
Set the card background to be an image instead of just a color

change the sourse from istagram to use for example FourSquare API instead (https://developer.foursquare.com/)
